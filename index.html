                her to pray for the conversion of sinners, as well as to tell
                the priests to build a chapel there. The water from the spring
                at Lourdes has miraculously healed many people of infirmities.

                  Handmaids of the Eucharist in the city of Akita Japan. Sr. Agnes

                  sacrifices, do acts of penance, visit the Blessed Sacrament, all
                  in order to make reparations for the sins of the world, and help

            <h2>Marian Catholic Devotions</h2>
            <p>
              Throughout history, Christians have shown great respect, love, and
              admiration to Mary. Having a devotion to the Virgin Mary is
              <i>NOT</i> the same as worshipping her and placing her above God.
              Because God created her to be the mother of His only beloved Son,
              Jesus Christ, Mary is praised and honored for having such an
              important role in the story of salvation, and it is why she will
              always lead us to Jesus. The checklist denotes popular Marian
              devotions practiced around the world.
